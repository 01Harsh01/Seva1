// ============================================================
//  js/categoryConfig.js
//  Centralized Service Category Configuration System.
//
//  This is the ONE place that defines what makes each category
//  feel bespoke: theme colors, hero copy, service list, FAQs,
//  features, testimonials, emergency types, and the fields the
//  booking form should ask. Every dynamic page (category.html,
//  booking.html, emergency.html, admin-dashboard.html) reads
//  from getCategoryConfig() instead of hardcoding any of this.
//
//  Defaults live in DEFAULT_CONFIG below. Admins can override any
//  field per category from admin-dashboard.html → Categories;
//  overrides are merged on top of the defaults and persisted in
//  localStorage, so this is API-ready: a real backend just needs
//  to serve/save the same shaped JSON per category (see
//  "categories" in the Firestore-style collection list in the
//  README) and these functions can be pointed at it instead.
// ============================================================
